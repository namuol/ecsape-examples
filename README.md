# [ecsape](http://github.com/namuol/ecsape) examples

These are barebones examples of how to use the "ecsape" Entity Component System ...system.

Ecsape was designed to get out of your way to help you build a more feature-complete
game framework, so the examples here may seem a bit contrived and verbose.

## Build Instructions

Pre-built bundles should already exist, but if you want to hack any of these examples, this is all you need:

```shell
npm install -d
make
```
